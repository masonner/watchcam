watchcam program for raspi + raspi-cam based on open source "motion"

Function:
sends E-mail with picture if motion detects motion
copy .mp4 to NAS
logs everything

Parts:
cam_main_detected.py - main, called from motion (motion.conf) if motion detected
cam_pictures.py - get last pictures
cam_mail.py - creates mail and attaches last pictures
cam_stamp.py  - set timestamp, to prevent an E-mail tsunami
cam_constant.py  - all necessary constants like directories, E-MAIL-address...
cam_for_ios.sh - convert motion-.avi in .m4v incl. transfer to NAS, every 5 min - via cron
cam_delete_old_files.sh - delete motion files older than 1 days - via cron


motion:
after changing motion.conf -> sudo service motion stop / start
have a look at /tmp/motion.log if problems - part of start procedure in motion.conf

Environment Variable: Not used

directories:
/home/pi/Projekte/repositories/watchcam: all sources
/home/pi/Bilder/cam: place where motion puts all its .jpg and .avi
/home/pi/Bilder/cam/buffer: transfer place for .avi before converting
/home/pi/fritz_speicher: NAS, mounted

conditions:
CRON: local crontab table is filled - crontab -e (no user!)
NAS is mounted 
fill fstab mit data for Fritzbox
/etc/rc.local: mount -a because fstab does no automount, give 10 sec wait before
service motion is started (standard, but check)
motion must have "w"-rights on Project directories
shell scripts are included in crontab

logs:
/home/pi/Projects/repositories/watchcam/soncam.log - Python log
/tmp/motion.log - stdout from cam_main_detetected, redirected in motion.conf
/tmp/cronlog(1).log -stdout from cronjob
/tmp: rc.log - only a short info from rc.local
